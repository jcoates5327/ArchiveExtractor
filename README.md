# ArchiveExtractor
A collection of Python scripts I wrote to help a university move its literary magazine archives to a new hosting service. There was a specific way they wanted this done, which was not particularly efficient; nonetheless these scripts aim to automate as much of that process as possible. Makes extensive use of the BeautifulSoup library for parsing HTML.
